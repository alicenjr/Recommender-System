# 🎬 Movie Recommender System

A content-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies similar to user preferences. This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze movie features and provide personalized recommendations.

## 📋 Overview

This recommender system analyzes movie characteristics such as genres, cast, crew, keywords, and overview to find similarities between movies and generate relevant recommendations. It's built using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques.

## ✨ Features

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on movie features and characteristics
- **Similarity Calculation**: Uses cosine similarity or other distance metrics
- **Feature Engineering**: Processes and combines multiple movie attributes
- **Interactive Analysis**: Jupyter notebook with visualizations
- **Scalable**: Can handle large movie datasets

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Feature Extraction**: Extracts key features from movie metadata (genres, cast, director, keywords, overview)
2. **Text Processing**: Combines and processes text features into a single representation
3. **Vectorization**: Converts text data into numerical vectors (TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer)
4. **Similarity Computation**: Calculates similarity scores between movies
5. **Recommendation**: Returns top-N most similar movies to a given movie

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alicenjr/Recommender-System.git
cd Recommender-System
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

3. Open the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook movie_reco.ipynb
```

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses movie datasets containing:
- **Movie Metadata**: Title, overview, genres, release date, runtime, budget, revenue
- **Credits**: Cast and crew information
- **Keywords**: Movie keywords and tags
- **Ratings**: User ratings (if using collaborative filtering)

## 🔧 Implementation

### Content-Based Filtering Steps:

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Load movie datasets
   - Handle missing values
   - Data type conversions

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extract genres, cast, crew, keywords
   - Combine text features
   - Create feature vectors

3. **Text Vectorization**
   - TF-IDF Vectorization or Count Vectorization
   - Remove stop words
   - Normalize vectors

4. **Similarity Matrix**
   - Calculate cosine similarity between all movies
   - Create similarity matrix

5. **Recommendation Function**
   - Input: Movie title
   - Output: Top N similar movies with similarity scores

## 💡 Key Concepts

**Cosine Similarity:**
```
similarity = cos(θ) = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)
```

Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, ranging from -1 to 1 (or 0 to 1 for positive features).

**Content-Based Filtering:**
- Recommends items similar to what the user liked in the past
- Based on item features and characteristics
- No cold start problem for new users (with historical preferences)

## 📈 Example Usage

```python
# Get recommendations for a movie
recommendations = get_recommendations('The Dark Knight', top_n=10)

# Output:
# 1. Batman Begins (similarity: 0.87)
# 2. The Dark Knight Rises (similarity: 0.85)
# 3. Man of Steel (similarity: 0.76)
# ...
```

## 🔍 Recommendation Techniques

This project can implement:
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Based on movie features
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Based on user behavior (if rating data available)
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both methods
